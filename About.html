    <h3>Isabella Rios</h3>
    <p> I'm interested in computer science, but specifically 
        in Artificial Intelligence. As a hard-of-hearing girl aspiring to succeed in 
        the STEM field, creating a space for all kinds of people where they feel included
        is something I hope to contribute to in a significant way.

        <h3>Isabella Loaisiga</h3>
        <p> Hello my name is Isabella Loaisiga and I’ve loved science ever since 4th grade. Specifically
            I’ve had a fascination on space and space travel. This plays a big factor on why I chose this 
            competition I wanted to expand my knowledge on space tourism and even coding so I did plenty of research 
            for the website. I also have loved digital design for the longest time and expressed my creative side in multiple 
            ways during this project.

            <p> My name is Nathalie Rodriguez and i’ve been interested in the computer science field since I was little. 
                Since my mom studied Computer Science, i’ve been hearing about the wonders it could do for humanity since a young age. 
                As of recently, I’ve started trying to learn to code find out about these wonders for myself. This competition is a way 
                for me to do that and explore the world of web development.
